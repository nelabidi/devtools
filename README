vsxa2p is a small tool I use it used in VS2008 C# Express as an external tool to be able to attach to a running process for debugging, helpful if you are making a DLL ( a pluging for example to some program ..etc)

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
the trick is to look-up a file moniker registered in the ROT (Running Object Table) as a EnvDTE.Solution object getting that object we can get the EnvDTE.DTE object, than all what we can do is to lookup the process we need to attach to using EnvDTE.Debugger

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. download and compile th source code to some folder.
2. in VS2008 C# express add an external tool and specify the name of the process (.EXE file name) you want to attach to example: vsxa2p $(SolutionFileName)   dir\\process.exe
3. assign a Keyboard shortuct to the tool  
4. done !


You are free to modify the tool to fit your need, please leave a comment or any suggestion

Happy coding :)
